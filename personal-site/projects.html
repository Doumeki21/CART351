      <h1>Power Play</h1>
      <p class="members">Olenka Yuen & Shayne Laroque</p>
      <h2 id="description">Description</h2>
      <p>
        Our starting topic is power consumption. It is a pertinent point of
        discussion for us personally, and highly important headline culturally,
        meriting further exploration because it is something which has a variety
        of impacts in today’s society; economic considerations from rising costs
        of goods and services due to the pandemic, increasing pressure to be
        mindful of one’s carbon footprint for environmental, and, while not
        directly related to us personally here in Canada, the war in Ukraine and
        the resulting media messaging directed towards Western Europe to reduce
        power consumption in an effort to ease off of Russian energy, which
        consequently only furthers the global population's mindfulness of this
        topic.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is an important topic to look into as an explorable networked space
        because of its daunting nature. “Power consumption”, to many, is both
        progressively taking up more space in the public psyche while remaining
        entirely intangible to the layman. People are aware of the general need
        to lower their consumption for any of the reasons listed above, but are
        either indifferent because of ignorance, or disillusioned because of the
        scale of power consumption differences between individuals and large
        corporations. With our exploration of the topic as a networked space, we
        hope to confront the users with their expenditure habits as well as have
        them leave the experience feeling empowered to take action in their
        daily lives to help lower their power consumption.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The kind of relationship we hope to foster with this project is one
        where the users do not feel they are being patronized, but rather create
        a feeling of mutual respect. We are hoping to achieve this by having the
        interface and experience apply the principles of Design Thinking and
        truly empathize with where the users are coming from to serve their
        specific needs.
      </p>
      <p>
        By having users participate in an immersively presented, limited
        presumption survey, in conjunction with other data, we hope to challenge
        and destabilize the users by understanding where they are coming from in
        their responses through the use of logic jumps to guide them through the
        journey of the presentation/survey questionnaire that will give them
        shock value by immediately challenging their responses or expanding on
        them through previously collected survey responses or third party data,
        interesting visualizations of the data, and related visuals such as
        photo and video.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        In the context of empowerment, we approached the ideation of our
        networked space specifically with the goal to help, challenge, and teach
        users. It does so by taking user input and challenging their assumptions
        about their own power consumption directly, through smart data driven
        retorts to their survey responses. We hope not to dissuade people from
        taking action through these retorts by hitting them depressing data, but
        instead provide the bigger picture and then zoom in and provide bite
        sized solutions they can tackle with the right tools. We chose this
        approach because, from our research, a lot of the resources online are
        way too much information with little direction (Honorable mention to the
        horribly ironic
        <a
          class="text-link"
          target="_blank"
          href="https://www.bp.com/en_gb/target-neutral/home/calculate-and-offset-travel-emissions.html#/"
          >BP Oil Carbon Footprint Calculator</a
        >). We hope to take similar information that many of these online
        resources used to display macro overviews of the energy dilemma and
        break it down into more municipal level actions, ranging from DIY home
        improvement upgrades, links to government incentivization programs for
        lowering one’s carbon footprint, transportation alternatives, and even
        dietary recommendations based on preferences.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, the users will be able to see how all survey responses stack up
        and see where common misconceptions lie. The overall goal is to present
        people, both the educated and uneducated, with a pointed perspective and
        actions they can take personally that will have measurable impact.

      <p>
        Loneliness: A Social Story “Loneliness: A Social Story” by Guangyu Du,
        Lucy Yip and Runjia Tianis of Harvard University Graduate School of
        Design, is a project to raise awareness on a social issue that many
        people feel, but is rarely spoken about. The project is a collection of
        visualized datasets and illustrations about loneliness. It shows several
        statistics or data that might factor into the cause, for example;
        population, region, gender, and lifestyle. Finally, the project ends by
        suggesting global funding or support centres as a call to action. This
        project is important because it gives voice to an experience that is
        often seen as taboo. It shows that loneliness is normal and that it can
        be a source of strength. The presentation is strengthened by the
        accompanying design language; the colour scheme, illustrations, and data
        visualizations all carry a melancholic, slow paced tone, which matches
        the messaging well.
      </p>
      <p>
        This all comes together to create a cohesive ensemble which is not only
        an aesthetically pleasing work but one which has merit as a teaching
        tool.

      ><img class="project" src="assets/images/cysmn.jpg" alt="" />
      <p>
        Can You See Me Now is a mixed-reality chase game developed by two
        companies, Blast Theory and The Mixed Reality Lab in 2001. This game
        gives a modern twist to hide and seek by having the hiders hide in the
        virtual world and the seekers seek their targets in the real world. The
        users will control an avatar while the seekers will hold a GPS device to
        track the avatars during the play.

        The Nature Conservancy includes a calculator on their site that allows
        the user to track their carbon footprint by inputting the user’s daily
        energy consumption. How the calculator works is that it asks the user to
        input information such as, the number of people you live with, how many
        calories of food you consume per day, what vehicle you use, and how many
        miles you travel. It’s a utilitarian tool with a clear use case designed
        to cut to the chase, designed to get out of the way visually.

        <h3 id="difference">How Will It Be Different</h3>
        <p>Our project is inspired from the above sources, and will take the lessons from the best and worst of them to inform our design and creation process of our initial vision. From your typical carbon footprint calculator to the access of user location data, we can collect a data point that can be part of the data set used to craft a pleasing visual narrative. In addition to the Loneliness project, we can build around an issue that is often overlooked (climate change) and encourage people to change their habits as well.</p>
